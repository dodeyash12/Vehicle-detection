Project: Vehicle Detection Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on vehicle detection by utilizing multiple machine learning techniques, including HOG + SVM, Decision Trees, CNNs, and YOLO. The goal is to develop an accurate model capable of distinguishing vehicles from non-vehicles in images.

Approach
Decision Tree: Used for initial classification.
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) + Support Vector Machine (SVM): Extracts feature descriptors and classifies vehicles.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Improves detection accuracy using deep learning.
YOLO (You Only Look Once): Enables real-time vehicle detection.
Results & Conclusion
The study compares traditional machine learning methods with deep learning approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs and YOLO in enhancing accuracy and efficiency in vehicle detection.

This repository contains the dataset, code implementation, and evaluation results of the different models.
